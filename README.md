## Optimizations:

Future improvements will aim for optimizations in:

- [ ] (back-end) controlling & limiting the rate of incoming requests from a set of IP addresses in order to protect the Server from potential brute-force attacks

- [x] (front-end) proficiently data caching & synchronizing with server state with [TanStack Query (F.K.A React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). Instead of requesting data every time user navigating to each page 
      
- [ ] (front-end) displaying shorter Pagination indicator for better UI. Instead of whole total pages which might cause bugs if user creates too many job applications

- [x] migrating to TypeScript for better self-documenting codebase and improves code readability
